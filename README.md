Notes:

- For notification support please install groovyAPI in cydia

- Changing the settings through the Lockhtml3 app might not work fully, I recommend editing options.js with iFile, or on your PC. In fact, changing it on the PC is even better because you can test it quickly by opening LockBackground.html in your browser.

- If you want to use this as a SBHTML theme, then rename the file as such:
LockBackground.html ===> Wallpaper.html
