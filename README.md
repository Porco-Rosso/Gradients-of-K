Notes:

- There may be some issues with the release, as I haven't had much time to beta-test it. Nevertheless this theme is quite versatile, and there are infinite possibilities, I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with! If there are any problems reach me on deviantart or reddit, under the username drpoup. 

- For notification support please install groovyAPI in cydia

- Changing the settings through the Lockhtml3 app might not work fully, I recommend editing options.js with iFile, or on your PC. In fact, changing it on the PC is even better because you can test it quickly by opening LockBackground.html in your browser.

- If you want to use this as a SBHTML theme, then rename the file as such:
LockBackground.html ===> Wallpaper.html
